# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Coalitional Formation Games

This repository contains all files related to simulating the coalitional formation games and applying MARL algorithms to solve for the stable coalition structure.

This is the up-to-date repository containing all relevant files to the present research. Branches contain different versions of the base model, for control testing. Branches of those branches are alterations pertaining to a specific feature e.g the communication protocol. See branches for the list of these, and their respective READMEs.
