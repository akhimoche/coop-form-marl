# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Coalitional Formation Games

This repository contains all files related to simulating the coalitional formation games and applying MARL algorithms to solve for the stable coalition structure. This is the base model:

- Payoffs are shared equally amongst members of a coalition
- No individual rationality condition for stability
